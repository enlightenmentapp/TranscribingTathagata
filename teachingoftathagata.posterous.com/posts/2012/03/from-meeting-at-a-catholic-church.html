<div class='post_body'><p>If somebody really does something good, mass media doesn't deal. Where are the better things to reveal the world? When somebody reveals the world, people can protect themselves from deceiving and they can live on the right way. But, at this moment, religions use Jesus.</p>
<p>When we say truth it means that there is a way in the problem. I haven't found any religion that has the way and a truthful teaching.&nbsp;</p></div>
