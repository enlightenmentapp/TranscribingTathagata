## Note from the Publisher

Contained at this website are some transcriptions I've made from parts of audio recordings of Korean-English interpretations in Enlightened master Tathagata's worldwide travels.

Please know, that any statements in parentheses found here are revised or alternate translations of Master Tathagata's words given by the interpreter at the time in the recording itself. I know that I have made about five to ten minor conjugation-related revisions to improve English readability only whenever I felt absolutely certain it would not change the meaning. But besides those few cases, especially since I do not know Korean natively and given the importance of His words, I did not change any words, nor add any of my own words, nor try to correct any translations, and I was very careful to write down only exactly what I heard in the recording. I did have to make a few guesses and tried to point it out if I had trouble understanding it.

Please keep in mind that I also could not tell the degree of accuracy of the translation as I can't speak Korean. So these transcriptions really need to be confirmed through Master's original words.
In case I had to include any transcription notes inline with the content of the recording, I made them very clear by using square brackets [like this].
