# Transcribing Tathagata

## Contents

Contained herein are select transcriptions of audio recordings of philosophy, science, etc. talks and conversations with a philosopher who referred to himself as Tathagata.

I had initially published this content on a website called Posterous but the company closed down.

So I've taken the same content from that website and republished it here as it was at the time it was published, except converted into Markdown format in some cases.

That content can be found under the folder called "teachingoftathagata.posterous.com".




## "Why People Don't Want to See Him"

Sometime shortly after 2010, after showing strong and continued interest in the teachings of the great traveling philosopher and self-claimed [Enlightened master Tathagata](http://members.tripod.com/tathagata2000) for many years, I became the recipient of a DVD of many audio recordings made of this master's travels around the world – specifically those from his 2004 travels to Thailand and 2007 travel to USA the year before his death.

During this traveling of Tathagata's, he would visit religious leaders, professors, prominent members of society (such as politicians), journalists, and so on. He would do so, in my understanding, in order to contribute his special and exceedingly rare knowledge and information to humanity for its present and its future. It seems that he found that the people in high positions didn't quite understand the substance of their own fields of study, meanwhile, he was able to answer the questions in those fields that people posed to him. He claimed to be able to reveal the truth of any field. Listening to the recordings, most obviously his discussions about philosophy and religious / spiritual matters, this was unarguably apparent to me. 

During his 2004 Thailand travels, Tathagata was accompanied by long-time disciple, Buddhist nun, and interpreter, Soyun, plus a traveling companion named Satto (aka Alberto), plus an Australian individual named Dominique.

During the trip, Dominique was considering writing a book to hold written accounts of these travels of Tathagata.

At a certain point while they were relaxing in the hotel and talking, Soyun remarked to Dominique with a laugh (paraphrased from memory), "Ah, the Master has given you a title for your book: 'Why People Don't Want to See Him'."


---------------------

Within the next year upon receipt of these recordings, having listened to them many, many times, and having continuously refined my understanding of the words therein, I began to think of what service I could do with this beautiful content. The thought occurred to me: not everyone can easily listen to the back-and-forth Korean-English translations that are happening in the audio files, plus, it takes a lot of time and effort to listen carefully, and plus, it's not always easy to make out the words… people might misunderstand some things, lose their patience, leave, etc., and miss out on crucial information which is not published anywhere else. In addition there are some who simply don't have the ability listen to audio such as those with impaired hearing. So the plan of transcribing certain parts of the recordings which I thought were particularly interesting or useful began to form within me, and shortly, I began to carry it out.
